## __Project Description__

The project recreated the classic console Snake game offering nostalgic and interesting behavior. The user moves Snake character through UP,DOWN,RIGHT and LEFT
keys on the keyboard and tries to collect as many as possible apple characters while each time the user collects it, the score increments. The game was made in C# using Visual Studio 2022.

## __How it works__

User moves the snake through UP,DOWN,RIGHT and LEFT keys on the keyboard. Each time the snake eats an apple, its size grows and the score increments.
The goal is to collect as many as possible apples while avoiding to touch the borders of the area and to not touch the body of snake through movement.
